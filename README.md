# message-in-bmp
A script that allows users to put a secret message of their choosing into a .bmp file.
Script is written in Python 3. Image files to be used need to be in the same folder as the script. As of now, entering a filename for an image that doesn't exist will crash the program. Just a fun way to use "least important bit" to hide a message in the binary of the .bmp file.
